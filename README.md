# my_work_day_scheduler

This application is a 9am-5pm work day scheduler. When a user opens the application the current work day is displayed so the user knows the exact day it is. 

There are one hour blocks of time listed for the user to place and plot their daily activities. Each block of time is color coded to notify the user as to the time of day. Blocks of time in the past appear in grey, the present time block appears in red, and future time blocks appear in green. Once a time block is chosen, the user is able to type in the activities they would like to schedule for that block. 

After the event is entered the user is able to click the save button next to the chosen time block to save the input into local storage.
